          Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.
          Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other oeple
          who will later need to figure out what that code does.
        </p>
        <p>There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:</p>
        <h3>1. Single line comment</h3>
        <p>
          Using <span>//</span> wll tell Java Script to ignore the reminder of
          the text on the current line. This is am in-line comment:
        </p>
        <div><p>//This is an inline comment.</p></div>
        <h3>2. Multi-line comment</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a multi-line comment beggining with <span>/*</span> and
          ending with <span>/*</span>. This is a multi-line comment:
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            /*This is a <br />
            multi-line comment*/
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong>: As you write code, you should regularly add
          comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good
          commenting can helo communicate the intent of your code-both for
          others and for future self.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style="flex: 1">
        <p>
          <strong>Exercise:</strong> Try creating one of each type of comment.
        </p>
