      "In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.",
      "Example",
      "'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'",
      "The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. Another use for it would be saving an a tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string.",
      "Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you will need to add them yourself.",

      "const ourStr = 'I come first. ' + 'I come second.'",
      "The string 'I come first. I come second.' would be displayed in the console.",
