      "A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do this is with a for loop. This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:",
      "const arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6];",
      "for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ) {",
      "console.log(arr[i]);",
      "}",
      "Remember that arrays have zero-based indexing, which means the last index of the array is length - 1. Our conditon for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops the loop when i is equal to length. In this case, the last iteration is i === 4, i.e when i becomes equal to arr.length -1 and outputs 6 to the console. Then i increases to 5, and the loop terminates because i < arr.length is false. "
