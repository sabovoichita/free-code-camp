      "A new feature of ES6 is the template literal. This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.",
      "Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.",
      "Consider the code below:",
      "const person = {",
      " \tname:'Zodiac Hasbro',",
      " \tage:56",
      "}",
      "const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}! I am ${person.age} years old.`;.",
      "console.log(greeting);",
      "",
      "The console will display the string 'Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro!' and 'I am 56 years old.','A lot of things happened here. Firstly, the example uses backticks(``), not quotes('' or \"), to wrap the string. Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line, both in the code and in the output. This saves inserting / within strings. The ${variable} syntax used above is a placeholder. Basically, you won't have to use concatenation with the + operator anymore. To add variables to strings, you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap it with $ { and }. Similarly, you can include other expressions in your string literal, for example ${a + b}. This new way of creating strings gives you more flexiblity to create robust strings."
